# Learning how to structure State _well_

I have been working with React for a few months now, but ✨fancy✨ state management tools still give me the whirling fantods. I usually stick to useState… but I know that it isn’t the answer for everything! I am finally comfortable taking a deep dive into the inner-workings of managing state because [React’s new Docs (in Beta)](https://beta.reactjs.org/) are wonderfully written and much more approachable than their previous iteration.

Quick shoutout to Rachel + Theo! If it wasn't for your chat on the new react Beta docs, the docs would have most likely lived a lonely life as another unopened tab on my browser.
