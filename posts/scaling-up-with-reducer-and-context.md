## \***\*Scaling Up with Reducer and Context\*\***

Here is how you can combine a reducer with context:

1. **Create** the context.
2. **Put** state and dispatch into context.
3. **Use** context anywhere in the tree.

I read it but I didn’t take too many notes because my guy Jack just went over all of it. I will most likely break up each of these sections into its own post. After I do that, I’ll edit what was written and most likely revisit the content here so that I can feel comfortable about my writing.

Congrats on getting through it!

I think that it would be nice to have more examples of code + a way to show off my knowledge (more than just writing about it) when I do make edits to these files. Bump it up a level, why don’t ya? That’ll be on the to do list
