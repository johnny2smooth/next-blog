## Summary

Dunno yet

FLEX BASIS! Flex basis tells the browser that there are certain *ideal* sizes that an element should be. It is then free to calculate its size. Let the browser help you out man!

Every user will be interacting with your website under different circumstances.

`inline-size`? What is that? Theyâ€™re hinting that it is the proper alternative to `width`.

```css
.grid {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.grid > * {
  flex: 1 1 20rem;
}
```

> ThatÂ `[flex`Â shorthand property](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex/) translates toÂ *"let each element grow and shrink to fill the space, but try to make it aboutÂ `20rem`Â wide"*.
> 

### The solution

Switcher. It switches a flexbox context between vertical and horizontal layout at a given, *container* based breakpoint.

> TheÂ `flex-basis`Â value enters the (current) width of the container, expressed asÂ `100%`, into a calculation with the designatedÂ `30rem`Â breakpoint.
> 

`30rem - 100%`

> Depending on the parsed value ofÂ `100%`, this will return either aÂ *positive*Â orÂ *negative*Â value: positive if the container is narrower thanÂ `30rem`, or negative if it is wider. This number is then multiplied byÂ `999`Â to produce either aÂ *very large*Â positive number or aÂ *very large*Â negative number:
>

`(30rem - 100%) * 999`;

```css
.switcher > * {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.switcher > * > * {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: calc((30rem - 100%) * 999);
}
```

> A negativeÂ `flex-basis`Â value is invalid, and dropped. Thanks to CSSâ€™s resilient error handling this means just theÂ `flex-basis`Â line is ignored, and the rest of the CSS is still applied. The erroneous negativeÂ `flex-basis`Â value is corrected toÂ `0`Â andâ€”becauseÂ `flex-grow`Â is presentâ€”each element grows to take up an equal proportion of horizontal space.
> 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The previous statement,Â *"each element grows to take up an equal proportion of the horizontal space"*Â is true where theÂ *content*Â of any one element does not exceed that alloted proportion. To keep things in order, nested elements can be given aÂ `max-inline-size`Â ofÂ `100%`.

```css
.switcher {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: var(--s1);
}

.switcher > * {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: calc(( 30rem - 100%) * 999);
}

.switcher > :nth-last-child(n+ 5),
.switcher > :nth-last-child(n+ 5) ~ * {
  flex-basis: 100%;
}
```
