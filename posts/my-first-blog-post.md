# Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to my space. If you’d like to get to know me a bit better, please stick around. This is the place where I let ideas flow and try to reinforce what I know. I have been studying web development off and on for about a year now, but I feel like things are finally in full swing. I’ve spent too long trying to be perfect, now I’d rather make things no matter how they end up.

```jsx
let testing = true;
```

## About me…

My name is John Peterson. To me this is a bland name. I feel like it does not necessarily match my personality. I do not identify as _bland_. I identify as an extroverted-introvert who loves to play sports, share drinks with my friends, and just kinda chill. Well, I take that _chill_ part back. I have a hard time with chilling. Don’t get me wrong! I can be a chill guy. I’m cool, I’m cool.

Right? I look cool. I can talk cool. But what I am not chill about is…

> Don’t give up!
